3113,"The bug report suggests an update related to 'VanillaIceCream' and mentions support for 'UpsideDownCake'. The key areas of concern are potentially related to how these two components interact or are managed within the application's framework, particularly concerning configuration or resource management. The lack of explicit files matching these names indicates that they may not be directly implemented or that the functionality is handled differently. This necessitates a broader search into methods and classes that would interact with or manipulate these components. Keywords to focus on include 'update', 'support', 'resources', and 'configuration'. The provided links may contain specific change logs detailing what aspects were modified, which hint at methods responsible for resource management or APK decoding.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""brut.apktool/apktool-cli/src/main/java/brut/apktool/Main.java"", ""justification"": ""Contains methods that deal with decoding APK files and configuring options which may relate to how the VanillaIceCream and UpsideDownCake functionalities are set up or modified during resource processing.""}, {""file"": ""brut.apktool/apktool-lib/src/main/java/brut/androlib/res/Framework.java"", ""justification"": ""Includes methods to publicize resources which could be crucial since the bug report mentions support for new functionality; alteration in resources management might link to the reported issue.""}, {""file"": ""brut.apktool/apktool-lib/src/main/java/brut/androlib/res/AndrolibResources.java"", ""justification"": ""Handles resource tables directly; since 'VanillaIceCream' and 'UpsideDownCake' may need specific resources, any flaws in resource decoding or management could be tied to the bug.""}, {""file"": ""brut.apktool/apktool-lib/src/main/java/brut/androlib/Config.java"", ""justification"": ""Manages configuration settings which could affect how options for VanillaIceCream and UpsideDownCake are set or overridden.""}, {""file"": ""brut.apktool/apktool-lib/src/main/java/brut/androlib/ApkDecoder.java"", ""justification"": ""Responsible for decoding the APK and handling how resources and configurations are laid out; critical for understanding how the updates might impact the app.""}, {""file"": ""brut.apktool/apktool-lib/src/main/java/brut/androlib/res/data/ResTable.java"", ""justification"": ""Contains methods that relate to resource specifications; if the update pertains to how resources are indexed or used, this file is highly relevant.""}]}","brut.apktool/apktool-lib/src/main/java/brut/androlib/res/AndrolibResources.java,brut.apktool/apktool-lib/src/main/java/brut/androlib/res/data/ResConfigFlags.java"
