923,"The bug report highlights issues with handling large strings in tests, particularly indicating that the method 'TextBuffer.contentAsString()' is where the problem manifests, as it only catches issues during the string conversion and does not handle exceptions during buffer extension properly. There is a mention of specific tests (#383) and the test method 'testBiggerString', which could be crucial for identifying problematic behavior with large inputs. The report emphasizes that the existence of a separate logic in TOML handling bypasses these checks, which warrants investigating methods related to 'TextBuffer'.
