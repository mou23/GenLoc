3759,"The bug report emphasizes an issue concerning the `@HeaderMap` annotation, specifically that its parameter type should be a `Map` while also hinting that it should support `Headers`. The snippet provided highlights a check within some method that throws an error when the parameter type is not assignable from `Map`, which is central to the reported bug. Keywords to focus on include `@HeaderMap`, `Map`, and `Headers`, which suggest relevance to files that deal with HTTP headers or map parameters.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""retrofit-adapters/rxjava/src/main/java/retrofit2/adapter/rxjava/RxJavaCallAdapterFactory.java"", ""justification"": ""Contains a method `get(Type returnType, Annotation[] annotations, Retrofit retrofit)` which is relevant for processing annotations like `@HeaderMap`.
