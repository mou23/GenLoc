3418,"The bug report highlights an issue with the deserialization of an empty `List<String>` when the `ACCEPT_SINGLE_VALUE_AS_ARRAY` feature is enabled. Specifically, the report mentions that during deserialization, the empty list ends up being interpreted as a list containing a single empty string (`List.of("""")`). This indicates a potential problem in the handling logic of empty values within the deserialization process, specifically in classes that manage collections, such as `StringCollectionDeserializer`. The report suggests that the `isExpectedStartArrayToken` method in `FromXmlParser` may not handle this scenario correctly, leading to incorrect coercion outcomes during deserialization. The report proposes two possible fixesâ€”either modifying the logical checks in `FromXmlParser` or adjusting the order of operations in `StringCollectionDeserializer`.
