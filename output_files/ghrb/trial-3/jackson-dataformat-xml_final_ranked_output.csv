544,"The bug report indicates an issue with the interaction between two Jackson annotations: `@JacksonXmlText` and `@JsonRawValue`. Specifically, the bug states that when both annotations are applied to the same field, the `@JacksonXmlText` annotation has no effect, leading to unexpected XML output when the data is serialized. By analyzing keywords such as 'Jackson', 'Xml', 'RawValue', and 'Text', we can derive relevant file names and methods to examine. The benefit of these annotations in XML serialization suggests that the problem may primarily lie in the serialization process handled by certain Jackson components.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""src/test/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/ser/RawValueSerializationTest.java"", ""justification"": ""This file contains tests specifically related to raw value serialization, which is directly connected to the use of `@JsonRawValue`.
