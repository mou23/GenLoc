9444,"The bug report indicates an issue within the `ConsumerManager` class, specifically in the `registerConsumerWithoutSub` method. The error affects the `topicGroupTable`, where users expect to see a `topic-group` structure but observe a `topic-topic` structure instead. This discrepancy in the data stored within the `topicGroupTable` suggests that the method's logic for registering consumer groups and handling subscription data may not be functioning as intended.

This will involve modifications to the existing topic validation logic for these specific cases.
