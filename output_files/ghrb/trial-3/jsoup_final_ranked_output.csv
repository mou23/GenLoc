2010,"The bug report highlights that the method 'formData()' of the class 'FormElement' retrieves the 'input type=image' incorrectly. In the context of HTML forms, elements of type 'image' are often used for image submit buttons, which may not be included in the data payload when submitting form data. The report suggests improper handling of this input type. Key aspects to analyze include how the 'formData()' method assembles form data, particularly in relation to 'input type=image'. The bug may arise from methods that gather input data, process form submission, or manipulate document elements. The analysis will focus on the class 'FormElement' and related data assembly methods to find discrepancies that could lead to incorrect retrieval of the form input data.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""src/main/java/org/jsoup/nodes/FormElement.java"", ""justification"": ""Directly contains the 'formData()' method, which is central to the bug report.

1763,"The bug report indicates that there is a problem with the copy constructor of the 'Safelist' class in the org.jsoup.safety package. The copy constructor, expected to perform a deep copy of its data structures, instead refers to the original data structures, leading to unintended mutations. Notably, it highlights that the 'Map<TagName, Set<AttributeKey>>' is shared between instances. This issue directly relates to how the 'Safelist' object is initialized and cloned.

1871,"The bug report emphasizes the need to allow wildcards in whitelist attributes for HTML5 data attributes (e.g., 'data-foo', 'data-foo-bar'). The core issues are: 1) The current implementation requires explicit listing of each data attribute in the whiteslist to prevent removal by Jsoup.clean(). 2) Suggested solutions include adding wildcard support (e.g., 'data-*') or creating a method to allow all data attributes for a tag.

1950,"The bug report indicates an issue with HTML parsing, specifically regarding the handling of duplicate attributes in form elements.
