3759,"The bug report suggests an issue with the '@HeaderMap' annotation where it states that the parameter type must be a Map, but it indicates there's nuance, as the HeaderMap should support Headers, too. The code snippet provided illustrates a conditional check for whether the parameter type is of 'Headers' class and validates the parameter type against the Map class, throwing an error if the check fails, indicating a potential design or logical inconsistency between the expectations of the HeaderMap and its validation logic. The key terms to focus on include: '@HeaderMap', 'Map', 'Headers', 'validateResolvableType', 'parameterError'.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""retrofit-converters/moshi/src/main/java/retrofit2/converter/moshi/MoshiConverterFactory.java"", ""justification"": ""This file contains a method 'responseBodyConverter()' which may involve parsing the headers or the request body.
