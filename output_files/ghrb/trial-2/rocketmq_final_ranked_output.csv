9334,"The bug report suggests an enhancement to use fastjson2 instead of fastjson1. The terms ""fastjson1"" and ""fastjson2"" imply that these are libraries or components relied upon in the code, possibly in serialization processes. The mention of the ""broker module"" indicates that relevant code will likely be found within the broker-related files. The focus on replacing a library also highlights potential dependencies, configuration files, or interfaces that may need to be changed to adapt to fastjson2. Additionally, correlation with methods for serialization (e.g., parse and generation functionalities) is essential to track the adjustments rooted in serialization processes associated with the broker functionalities. Overall, the search will center around files that relate to both the broker module and serialization methods, particularly the ones specified in the FastJsonSerializer methods.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""common/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/common/utils/FastJsonSerializer.java"", ""justification"": ""This file directly implements serialization and deserialization methods using fastjson, making it central to the enhancement request to switch to fastjson2.""}, {""file"": ""broker/src/main/java/org/apache/rocketmq/broker/out/BrokerOuterAPI.java"", ""justification"": ""Contains broker functionalities relevant to registering and interacting with remote broker services.
