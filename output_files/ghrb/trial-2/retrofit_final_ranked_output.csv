3759,"The bug report indicates an issue with an annotated parameter (`@HeaderMap`) in Java code, specifically mentioning that the parameter type must be a `Map`. The relevant code snippet deals with type validation and a specific case where the type is `Headers.class`. The error suggests that the implementation might not properly handle cases beyond a standard `Map`, potentially leading to exceptions when other types of headers are passed. Keywords indicating relevant context include `@HeaderMap`, `Map`, `Headers`, and error handling logic.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""retrofit-adapters/rxjava/src/main/java/retrofit2/adapter/rxjava/RxJavaCallAdapterFactory.java"", ""justification"": ""This file contains the method `get()` which handles different return types including parameterized types.
