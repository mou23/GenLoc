544,"The bug report highlights an issue with the combination of two annotations, `@JacksonXmlText` and `@JsonRawValue`, resulting in undesired serialization behavior. This indicates the problem might lie within serialization logic, specifically in the context of XML handling. The relevant components are Jackson annotations, particularly those involving XML and JSON interoperability. Additionally, provided test cases suggest the expectation for specific XML output that must be achieved by the involved Java classes. This injury calls for focused investigation on methods and classes handling XML serialization related to the specified annotations.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""src/test/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/misc/TextValueTest.java"", ""justification"": ""This file is relevant as it deals with XML serialization and specifically tests behaviors associated with text values, which closely ties with the problem of using `@JacksonXmlText` alongside `@JsonRawValue`. Methods like `testTextOnlyPojo()` and `testSerializeAsText()` directly involve XML formats and handling of text values, making it a high priority for investigation.""}, {""file"": ""src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/ser/ToXmlGenerator.java"", ""justification"": ""As a core class responsible for generating XML output, this file likely implements the logic for handling the mentioned annotations during serialization.
