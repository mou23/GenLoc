11561,"The bug report mentions a `StackOverflowError` occurring in the `SerializeSecurityConfigurator`. The report references specific class definitions (`DemoService4` and `DemoService5`) hinting at generics or recursive definitions, which can cause stack overflow errors if methods call each other in a cyclic manner or if too many recursive calls exist. These classes are also not found in the codebase, thus it may be necessary to investigate classes involved in serialization and security within the provided files. Key components likely relate to serialization management and class loading, especially those where interfaces and dynamic classes might be involved as indicated by the class `Wrapper`.
