2010,"The reported bug states that the method ""formData()"" in the FormElement class retrieves ""input type=image"" incorrectly, indicating a possible flaw in data handling or the retrieval routine for that specific type of input element. The description emphasizes that while the HTML form includes an 'input type=image', it should not be included in the form data when the form is submitted, yet it appears to be retrieved improperly possibly due to an issue in the formData() implementation.

1950,"The bug report indicates that there is an issue with duplicate attributes in form elements when parsing HTML. Specifically, the attributes are expected to be deduplicated just like other HTML elements, but they are not, leading to incorrect behavior. The bug report includes a test case showing that duplicate attributes are not dropped as expected. The related methods mentioned in the bug report include `Parser.htmlParser()`, `Parser.xmlParser()`, and those that manipulate attributes such as `selectFirst`, `outerHtml`, and `getErrors`.

1871,"The bug report highlights a need to enhance the `Jsoup` library's capability regarding `data-` attributes in HTML elements. Specifically, it calls for the implementation of wildcards for attributes or a new function to allow `data-` attributes without explicitly listing each one on a whitelist. The critical keywords to note are 'wildcards', 'whitelist', 'data- attributes', and methods like `allowDataAttributes` or similar that could facilitate this functionality. The affected components likely include classes handling HTML attributes, generating cleaner outputs from raw HTML (`Cleaner.java`), and managing safety through a whitelist mechanism (`Safelist.java`).

1763,"The bug report indicates a problem with the copy constructor of the Safelist class. Specifically, it notes that the constructor does not perform a deep copy of nested data structures, leading to shared states across instances. The primary components impacted are the copy constructor (`public Safelist(Safelist copy)`) and the data structures involved, such as `Map<TagName, Set<AttributeKey>>`.
