2420,"The bug report focuses on improving the default ProGuard / R8 rules, particularly in relation to Gson's handling of Kotlin classes and abstract types. Key terms and phrases include ""no-args constructor,"" ""abstract classes,"" ""@Keep annotation,"" and specific recommendations for keeping constructors based on the presence of Gson annotations. The report suggests modifying the default rules to prevent R8 from making classes abstract when they should be kept accessible for deserialization. The troubleshooting guide indicates that current ProGuard rules may lead developers to encounter ""JsonIOException"" when they instantiate Kotlin classes that do not have a no-args constructor. Additionally, it suggests better practices for handling constructors and recommends using the @Keep annotation for Android developers to avoid unnecessary complexity. The report also highlights issues with the current guide's suggestions and advocates for a more flexible ProGuard configuration to accommodate Kotlin's constructor patterns.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/TroubleshootingGuide.java"", ""justification"": ""The file appears to contain logic or methods directly related to troubleshooting issues with deserialization in Gson.
