10958,"The bug report highlights problems with retry operations specifically in the `RpcClient`. This indicates that the relevant functionality involves retry logic that is not functioning as expected, particularly in a scenario where the retry count is set to 0, leading to a failure in making requests. Key terms extracted include 'Retry', 'RpcClient', and 'Request'. The behavior expected is that a request should still be sent even when retries are configured to 0.
