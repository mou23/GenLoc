The `generateNonce()` method creates and stores unique `NonceInfo` objects based on these nonces, but the implementation may allow two threads to overwrite each other's nonce data because they share the same key in the `nonces` map. Afterward, when `nonceCountValid()` checks the nonce count, it uses the same tracked state for both requests, which may incorrectly yield a failure in authentication for a valid request, especially under high concurrency scenarios.

56012,"The bug report describes an issue with import statement generation when using the `extends` attribute of the JSP page directive. The key takeaway is that if the superclass is a top-level class, it should not be imported explicitly, which is currently occurring. In the snippet provided, the method `setExtends` from the `PageInfo` class is particularly noted, as it controls how the `extends` attribute is processed, indicating potential areas of concern. The fact that it leads to an improper import declaration in the generated servlet further emphasizes the need for a thorough analysis of the relevant classes responsible for handling page directives in JSP.","{""ranked_list"": [{""file"": ""java/org/apache/jasper/compiler/PageInfo.java"", ""justification"": ""Contains the method `setExtends(String value, Node.PageDirective n)` which handles the `extends` attribute in JSP pages, directly related to the bug report.""}, {""file"": ""java/org/apache/jasper/runtime/HttpJspBase.java"", ""justification"": ""Has the `getServletInfo()` method, showcasing how servlet-related information is returned.
